## Introduction
Gopuff delivers thousands of everyday items, at your door in 30 minutes. Get everyday value in your pocket. Instantly. Gopuff
was a new start up working with all the latest technologies to build out a fully microservices environment. I worked largly
with kubernetes that deployed all services, pipleines to deploy them and terraform to create the infrastructure. This was my 
first full time position at a corporation and was the most intense, and efficient learning curve of my life. 

## Breakdown

#### Kubernetes
I was introduced to the entire ecosystem of kubernetes. The best resource to learn more about what is out there is through 
[CNCF Projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/). After getting the basics down with CRD's, kubectl and the general flow with helm. I started
to pick projects that interested me and implement ones that I thought would help. ArgoCD was my favoriate, but also really enjoyed 
working with OPA and prometheus. We ended up building a prod parallel environment were I learned about how to spin up services from terraform
up to proper service mesh routing.

#### CI/CD
Gopuff relied heavily on github actions. I learned how to run pipelines, architect repetable patterns and how to deploy services in production.
This is where I really learned about the importance of good architecture and how to set up services to catch bugs before prod.

#### Payments database migration
One of my hardest challenges was migrating our payments database from a shared relational DB to its own microserviced one. The solution required
no code changes which made duel writing impossible. I ended up running a pipeline to first to a bulk migration, and then smaller ones to 
migrate the new rows based on the timestamps of what data had not been migrated. We ended up doing this with only 2 minutes of downtime.
