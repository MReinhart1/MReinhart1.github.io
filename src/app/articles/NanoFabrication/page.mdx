## Introduction
Kingston NanoFabrication was a local business in Kingston Ontario that provided nanofabrication machines to scientists and engineers. They 
operated the payments and usage of the machines based on the honor system and manually wrote out the timestamps on paper. I was tasked with 
building a system to automate this process within a team of 4.

## Technologies
My team and I built out a website in python using flask for the UI, each machine was wired up to raspberry pi's that monitored usage using RFID
badge scanners. The raspberry pi's all communicated over the local network with the master node that the frontend UI integrated with. The lab managers
could manage users, track usage and bill customers. We included graphing technology for analytics to see what users used what machines and what machines
provided the most profit among other things.
