# Sapphir

## Introduction

Sapphir is an online micro loan company that specializes in small loans that can be fufilled in the same day. A user could select a loan ammount, and fill out an application.
The company would receive the application, review the users documents, check that they were qualified using the integrated 3rd party API to auto-approve the application, and sign the 
auto-templated contract. Payments history was available to be updated on all payments and exported when needed. The site was integrated with an online AI chat bot as well.

The website was broken up into:
- Loan information 
- User portal 
- Business portal for employees

## Technologies

The website was built out using javascript and express available in multiple languages. MongoDB was used for the database and nodemailer was used for emails.
